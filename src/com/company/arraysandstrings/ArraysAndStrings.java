// An Arraylist is an array that resizes itself as needed while still providing 0( 1) access.
// A typical implementation is that when the array is full, the array doubles in size.
// Each doubling takes 0( n) time, but happens so rarely that its amortized insertion time is still O ( 1).

// StringBuilder simply creates a resizable array of all the strings, copying them back to a string only when necessary.
