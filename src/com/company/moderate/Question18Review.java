//Pattern Matching: You are given two strings, pattern and value. The pattern string consists of
//        just the letters a and b, describing a pattern within a string. For example, the string catcatgocatgo
//        matches the pattern aabab (where cat is a and go is b). It also matches patterns like a, ab, and b.
//        Write a method to determine if value matches pattern.
