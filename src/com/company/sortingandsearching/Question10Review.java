//Rank from Stream: Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers. Periodically, you wish to be able
//        to look up the rank of a numberx (the number of values less than or equal to x). lmplement the data
//        structures and algorithms to support these operations. That is, implement the method track ( int
//        x), which is called when each number is generated, and the method getRankOfNumber(int
//        x), which returns the number of values less than or equal to x (not including x itself).

//        EXAMPLE
//        Stream (in order of appearance): 5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 9, 7, 13, 3
//        getRankOfNumber(1) 0
//        getRankOfNumber(3) = 1
//        getRankOfNumber(4) 3

// 9:20
